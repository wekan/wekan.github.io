              title: Stored XSS vulnerability in rename functionality

      fixed version: 
         CVE number: 
             impact: Medium

Vendor description:
------------------- 
WeKan ® is an completely Open Source and Free software collaborative
kanban board application with MIT license.

Whether you’re maintaining a personal todo list,
planning your holidays with some friends,
or working in a team on your next revolutionary idea, Kanban boards
are an unbeatable tool to keep your things organized.
They give you a visual overview of the current state of your project,
and make you productive by allowing you to focus on the few items that
matter the most.

Source: https://github.com/wekan/wekan

Business recommendation:
------------------------
Patch the application with the latest update supplied by the vendor.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Stored Cross-Site Scripting

An authenticated attacker with the role 'BoardAdmin' is able to rename
file attachments of Kanban cards. Being an admin of the Wekan instance
is not required in order for this exploit to work, as any user can
obtain 'BoardAdmin' privileges by creating a new Kanban board.

The 'renameAttachment' method does not sanitise user input and allows
embedding XSS payloads in the specified filename. The stored XSS payload is
triggered by opening the attachment as the modified filename is displayed in
the header bar of the file preview.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
The following steps are necessary to exploit the vulnerability:
1. Log into the application with at least "user" privileges
2a. Open a Kanban board in which you have 'BoardAdmin' privileges
2b. Or, create a new Kanban board otherwise
3. Create a Kanban card if none exist
4. Open Kanban card to edit it
5. If there is no attachment in the card, upload one
6. Click on "Attachment Actions" under the attachment and select "Rename"
7. Include arbitrary XSS payload such as the following inside the filename:

"[script]alert('Stored XSS')[/script]" (where change [] to open close tags)

8. Select "Save" to embed the XSS payload

Any user with access to the board clicking on the attachment preview
triggers the stored XSS. In case the used Kanban board is set to "public"
any person with a link to the board can access the targeted card and 
trigger the payload inside the attachments' filename.

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The following versions have been tested to be vulnerable:
* v6.64
* v6.69
* v6.71

TBD: According to the vendor, all previous versions are affected as well.

Vendor contact timeline:
------------------------
2023-02-16: Contacting vendor through email.

Solution:
---------
TBD: The vendor provides a patched version which should be installed immediately.
TBD: Link to vendor update & version information

Workaround:
-----------
None
